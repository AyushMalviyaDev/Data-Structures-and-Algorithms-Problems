Pattern - 3: Right-Angled Number Pyramid

Examples:

Input Format: N = 3
Result: 
1
1 2 
1 2 3

Input Format: N = 6
Result:
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5 6

approach: 
- outer loop goes from 1 to n for printing n no. of rows. 
- inner loop goes from 1 to <=i and print "j" (eg. at i=3, j goes from 1 to 3 " 1 2 3")

solution: 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void pattern3(int N)
{
    // This is the outer loop which will loop for the rows.
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    {
        // This is the inner loop which loops for the columns
       // no. of columns = row number for each line here.
       // Here, we print numbers from 1 to the row number
       // instead of stars in each row.
        for (int j = 1; j <=i; j++)
        {
            cout <<j<<" ";
        }
       
        // As soon as numbers for each iteration are printed, we move to the
        // next row and give a line break otherwise all numbers
        // would get printed in 1 line.
        cout << endl;
    }
}

int main()
{   
    // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
    // We can also take input from the user.
    int N = 5;

    pattern3(N);

    return 0;
}

Pattern-2: Right-Angled Triangle Pattern

Examples:

Input Format: N = 3
Result: 
* 
* * 
* * *

Input Format: N = 6
Result:
* 
* * 
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
* * * * * *

Approach: 
- outer loop will go from 0 to n-1 to print n no. of rows. 
- innner loop will go from 0 to <=i to print i number of rows. (eg.at i=1 inner loop will work for j=0 & j=1 and prints two stars)

solution: 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void pattern2(int N)
{
    // This is the outer loop which will loop for the rows.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        // This is the inner loop which loops for the columns
       // no. of columns = row number for each line here.
        for (int j = 0; j <=i; j++)
        {
            cout << "* ";
        }
       
        // As soon as stars for each iteration are printed, we move to the
        // next row and give a line break otherwise all stars
        // would get printed in 1 line.
        cout << endl;
    }
}

int main()
{   
    // Here, we have taken the value of N as 5.
    // We can also take input from the user.
    int N = 5;

    pattern2(N);

    return 0;
